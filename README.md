# 200 Days of Programming ‚Äî EEE 254 (Obafemi Awolowo University)

Hi there 

I'm currently offering **EEE 254 ‚Äì Introduction to Software Engineering** this semester at **Obafemi Awolowo University**, and as part of our coursework, we're taking on the **200 Days of Programming** challenge.

This repository is where I‚Äôll be uploading my Python practice files, examples, and small projects as I go through the challenge. Each file focuses on a concept we‚Äôve covered or practiced in class, ranging from basic algorithmic thinking to more structured programming ideas.

### üîç What you'll find so far:
- Finding the cube root of an integer using approximation and binary search
- Writing and organizing **functions**
- Understanding **recursion**, **scoping**, and the **call stack**
- **Modularizing** code for clarity and reusability
- Working with **tuples, lists, ranges**, and exploring the idea of **mutability**
- Uderstanding **asymptotic notation** and **Big(0) of n**
- **Newton-Rpahson Method** without using numpy
- Understanding **Classes** and **Subclassing** in Python
- **File Operations** in Python

I'll continue adding more files and concepts as the course progresses. You can also find these updates on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iseoluwa-oyesanmi-234bb1275/) where I‚Äôll be sharing key learnings and code snippets along the way.

Thanks for checking this out!
